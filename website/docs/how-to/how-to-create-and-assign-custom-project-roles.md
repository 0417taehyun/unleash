This guide takes you through [how to create](#creating-custom-project-roles "how to create custom project roles") and [assign](#assigning-custom-project-roles "how to assign custom project roles") [custom project roles](../user_guide/rbac.md#custom-project-roles).

## Creating custom project roles

To create custom project roles:

1. Navigate to the custom project roles page by using the admin menu (the gear symbol) and navigating to users.
2. Navigate to the "roles" tab.
3. Use the "new project role" button to open the role creation form.
4. Give the role a name, an optional description, and the set of permissions you'd like it to have. For a full overview of all the options, consult the [custom project roles reference documentation](../user_guide/rbac.md#custom-project-roles).

## Assigning custom project roles

To assign a custom project role to a user:
1. Navigate to the project you want to assign the user a role in.
2. Navigate to the project's _access_ page.
3. This step depends on whether the user has already been added to the project or not:
    - If the user has already been added to the project, select the new role you want to give them from the dropdown menu next to their name.
    - If the user _hasn't_ been added to the project, add them via the 'add user' form. Select the role you want to give them from the role field.
